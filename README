mUXI - mobile user experience / interface

Mu Xi, like the greek letters, but i have yet to come up with a Greek acronym

pronounced "muse eye" ... because that sounds creative :)

GOALS:
  - be a cross mobile browser frontend framework 
  - be light-weight
  - themeable
  - convention based 
  - utilize HTML5 and CSS3 where possible
