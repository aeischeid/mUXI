  <h2>Web 3.0?</h2>
  <p>Not sure if that really is the right term, but HTML 5 and CSS3 open up a realm of possibilities in web development and design. mUXI tries to take advantage of some of these emerging standards while maintaining some degree of graceful degregation for browsers that aren't quite there yet. The mobile web shouldn't be tied to one platform, but it shouldn't be held back by incapable platforms either. It is a tough balance to strike.</p>
  <h2>Conventions</h2>
  <p>Certain web frameworks have thrived on the concept of convention over configuration. It's a good idea! In this case, it just means that if you build your content according to the conventions it should just work. Fast. Easy.</p>
  <h2>Modular</h2>
  <p>Makes it simple to get rid of pieces you don't need or add new stuff, and also to apply you own style or behavior</p>
  <h2>Fast</h2>
  <p>Mobile devices and networks have come a long way. Still, on the mobile web 'fast' in large part depends on the content weight. Keeping it simple and light is a priority</p>
  <h2>Documented</h2>
  <p>Well sort of... the demo file are meant to act as documentation. The idea is 'show me' instead of 'tell me'.</p>
