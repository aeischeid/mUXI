  <h2>Web 3.0?</h2>
  <p>Not sure if that really is the right term, but HTML 5 and CSS3 open up a realm of possibilities in web development and design, as do mobile platforms like smartphones and tablets. mUXI tries to take advantage of some of these emerging standards and devices while maintaining some degree of graceful degregation for those that aren't quite there yet. The mobile web shouldn't be tied to one platform or one browser, but it shouldn't be held back by incapable platforms or browsers either. It is a tough balance to strike. For starters mobile webkit browsers (iPhone, Android, Palm etc.) will be the target with, Opera, Fennec, and others to follow.</p>
  <p>New device platforms also invite a re-think in user interface. Apple has set the bar hi with their design and usability, and many mobile frameworks simply aim to imitate. Rather than simply imitating, try building off of the underlying principles that made their stuff great. Simple, intuitive, fast, and look good doing it. How can you go wrong, right?! Using the pieces of other frameworks as a starting point the goal is to innovate and improve with a more generic flavor that is more fitting to the vendor neutrality of the web.</p>
  <h2>Conventions</h2>
  <p>Certain web frameworks have thrived on the concept of convention over configuration. It's a good idea meant to speed up development! In this case, it just means that if you build your content according to the conventions it should just work. Fast. Easy.</p>
  <h2>Modular</h2>
  <p>Makes it simple to get rid of pieces you don't need or add new stuff, and also to apply you own style or behavior</p>
  <h2>Fast</h2>
  <p>Mobile devices and networks have come a long way. Still, on the mobile web 'fast' in large part depends on the content weight. Keeping it simple and light is a priority</p>
  <h2>Documented</h2>
  <p>Well sort of... the demo file are meant to act as documentation. The idea is 'show me' instead of 'tell me'.</p>
