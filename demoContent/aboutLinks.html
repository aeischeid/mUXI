  <h2>About Links</h2>
  <p>By default links will be loaded via ajax if they point to external content. JavaScipt will do some hide and show work if they point to another section of the page</p>
  <p>Add target="_self" to override ajax behavior. Links can also be given target="_blank" just like typical html</p>
  <p>Curious what happens when you put a link in a paragraph? <a href="demoContent/link-types.html" target="_self">see more link type examples</a>. Just be careful of you url path, it gets a little tricky when content is loaded via ajax. You have to remember where you started from.
