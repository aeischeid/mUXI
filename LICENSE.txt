Currently a lot of this content is borrowed (stolen?) ... honestly I am not sure. I plan to make it unique content as I go. Please don't sue me or be mad. Imitation is a form of compliment :)

Eventually I will figure out some sort of 'real' licence. GPL, LGPL, MIT, BSD CreativeCommons... I don't know. Some sort of very free and open licence anyway.
